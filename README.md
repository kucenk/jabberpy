   ```

3. **Using Environment Variables** (optional):
   ```bash
   export XMPP_JID="your_bot@your_server.com"
   export XMPP_PASSWORD="your_password"
   python main.py
   ```

## Core Features

## Configuration

The bot uses `config.ini` for configuration with the following sections:

### [bot] Section
```ini
[bot]
jid = bot@example.com              # Bot's XMPP ID
password = your_password_here      # Bot's password
nickname = JabberBot              # Nickname in conferences
timezone = UTC                    # Timezone for announcements
auto_join_rooms = room1@conf.server.com,room2@conf.server.com
```

### [messages] Section
```ini
[messages]
greeting = Hello {nick}! Welcome to the conference! ðŸ‘‹
```

### [scheduler] Section
```ini
[scheduler]
hourly_announcements = true       # Enable/disable hourly time announcements
```

## Usage Examples

### Starting the Bot
```bash
# With debug logging
python main.py --debug

# With custom config file
python main.py --config my_config.ini

# Show help
python main.py --help
```

### Interacting with the Bot
In any conference room where the bot is present:

```
# Check if bot is working
!ping

# Get current time
!time

# See bot status
!status

# List all connected rooms
!rooms

# See who's in current room
